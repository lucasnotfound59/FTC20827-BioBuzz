 * ({@link Points.RedLeast#SHOOT_2}), shoot the 4 preloaded POLLEN, then PARK at
 * {@link Points.RedLeast#END} in the RED LOADING ZONE (LEAVE 3 + PARK 5).
 *

 * until the HIVE has tipped, and WAIT_BEFORE_PARK_SECONDS holds after shooting before parking.
 *
 * <p>Everything before the park drive is cut off PARK_RESERVE_SECONDS before the end so PARK
