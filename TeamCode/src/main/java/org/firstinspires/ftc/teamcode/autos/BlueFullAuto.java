/**
 * Blue max routine: the Red Full Auto turned 180 degrees about the Pedro field centre
 * (70.75, 70.75), so every BLUE point is (141.5 - x, 141.5 - y, heading + 180) of the RED one.
 * Field points live in {@link Points.Blue} (field frame, BLUE side):
 * <ol>
 * <li>START → SHOOT_1, wait until the robot is on the point, shoot the preload.</li>
 * <li>SHOOT_1 → FLOWER_PREP_1 lowering the splitter on the way; FLOWER_PREP_1 → FLOWER_1,
 *     collect.</li>
 * <li>FLOWER_1 → SHOOT_2; wait until on the point, wait WAIT_BEFORE_SHOOT_2_SECONDS, shoot.</li>
 * <li>SHOOT_2 → FLOWER_PREP_2 → FLOWER_2, collect.</li>
 * <li>FLOWER_2 → SHOOT_2; wait until on the point, wait WAIT_BEFORE_SHOOT_2_SECONDS, shoot.</li>
 * <li>SHOOT_2 → STOP_1 (PARK).</li>
 * </ol>
 * The splitter stays down through collection and retracts when the final park path starts.
 * The intake runs during collection and shooting, and slowly while carrying pollen. Everything before the park drive is cut off
 * PARK_RESERVE_SECONDS before the end so PARK always gets its time.
