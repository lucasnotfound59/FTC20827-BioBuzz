/**
 * Minimum BLUE routine, the RED Least Auto rotated to the BLUE side: drive from
 * {@link Points.Blue#START_2} to shooting position 2 ({@link Points.Blue#SHOOT_2}), shoot
 * the 4 preloaded POLLEN, then PARK at {@link Points.Blue#STOP_2} in the BLUE LOADING ZONE
 * (LEAVE 3 + PARK 5).
 *
 * <p>For cooperation with the partner on the other side, WAIT_BEFORE_SHOOT_SECONDS holds at shoot 2
 * until the HIVE has tipped, and WAIT_BEFORE_PARK_SECONDS holds after shooting before parking.
 *
 * <p>Everything before the park drive is cut off PARK_RESERVE_SECONDS before the end so PARK
 * always gets its time.
